Group Work: 
We planned out the broad picture of the program together. As to how to traverse through the data structure and what system-call to call. Khoa was excellent in writing the my_make, debugging, and did the first round of testing Sarah provided great insight as to how to specifically call which targets[] and what to do after calling and based on that, she helped writing my_make function. Chan wrote README file, warmup code, and execute_file function, which later got integrated into the my_make function. We met several times on campus and off campus in Brooklyn Park. The tests were done over SSH (csel-kh4250-40.cselabs.umn.edu) and VOLE. 
 
Instruction:
Go into the Project1_make4061 folder, using a terminal to call make on that address, and it will create a file named make4061.  If you run make4061 using ¡°./make4061¡± on that folder, it¡¯ll print all the message of make4061 is up to date. Using the make4061 file to test all other test cases by copying the make4061 to that test folder and run it. 

Note:
When tested over VOLE, there was a bug not printing the first line, but it was cleared off in the later attempts in the same setting. 
There's also some extra empty space print out when executing the ./make4061. My group asked TA about this problem, but they said it should be okay as long as it prints out the correct message.
